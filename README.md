## Botbuilder v4 Location Search

Compatible with **Botbuilder v4**. 
- [Sample source](https://github.com/Raj-kishore/Microsoft-Botbuilder-Location-Search/tree/master/Sample)
- [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botbuilder-location-bing-osm)

This package can fetch location data from Bing Maps or OSM. Go through [OSM Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/) before using their open resource directly. Instead rely on 3rd party services e.g. Mapbox, Mapquest etc or set up your own OSM server. This OSM sample is just for demo purpose and not for business use.
